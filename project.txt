Sure! Let's create a simple project that simulates a student management system. This project will involve loops for iterating through student records, conditions for checking grades, and object-oriented programming (OOP) for creating student objects.

Here's a basic outline of the project:

1. **Student Class**: Create a class called `Student` with attributes such as name, roll number, and grades.

2. **Student Management System Class**: Create a class called `StudentManagementSystem` to manage a collection of students. It should have methods for adding students, removing students, displaying student details, and calculating average grades.

3. **User Interface**: Implement a simple user interface that allows users to interact with the student management system. Users should be able to:
   - Add a new student
   - Remove a student
   - Display all students
   - Calculate the average grade of a student

Here's a Python implementation of this project:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_number):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_number = roll_number
        self.grades = []

    def add_grade(self, grade):
        self.grades.append(grade)

    def calculate_average_grade(self):
        if not self.grades:
            return 0
        return sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades)

class StudentManagementSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = []

    def add_student(self, student):
        self.students.append(student)

    def remove_student(self, roll_number):
        for student in self.students:
            if student.roll_number == roll_number:
                self.students.remove(student)
                print(f"Student {student.name} with roll number {student.roll_number} removed.")
                return
        print("Student not found.")

    def display_students(self):
        print("Student Details:")
        for student in self.students:
            print(f"Name: {student.name}, Roll Number: {student.roll_number}, Grades: {student.grades}")

    def calculate_student_average_grade(self, roll_number):
        for student in self.students:
            if student.roll_number == roll_number:
                average_grade = student.calculate_average_grade()
                print(f"Average grade for {student.name} (Roll Number: {student.roll_number}): {average_grade}")
                return
        print("Student not found.")

# Example usage:
student_system = StudentManagementSystem()

student1 = Student("Alice", "101")
student1.add_grade(90)
student1.add_grade(85)

student2 = Student("Bob", "102")
student2.add_grade(75)
student2.add_grade(80)

student_system.add_student(student1)
student_system.add_student(student2)

while True:
    print("\nMenu:")
    print("1. Add a new student")
    print("2. Remove a student")
    print("3. Display all students")
    print("4. Calculate average grade for a student")
    print("5. Exit")
    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

    if choice == "1":
        name = input("Enter student name: ")
        roll_number = input("Enter roll number: ")
        new_student = Student(name, roll_number)
        student_system.add_student(new_student)
        print("Student added successfully.")
    elif choice == "2":
        roll_number = input("Enter the roll number of the student to remove: ")
        student_system.remove_student(roll_number)
    elif choice == "3":
        student_system.display_students()
    elif choice == "4":
        roll_number = input("Enter the roll number of the student to calculate average grade: ")
        student_system.calculate_student_average_grade(roll_number)
    elif choice == "5":
        print("Exiting...")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

This project demonstrates loops (for iterating through students), conditions (checking student grades), and OOP (with the `Student` and `StudentManagementSystem` classes). You can extend it further by adding more features such as searching for students by name, implementing grade statistics, or storing student data in a file/database.
